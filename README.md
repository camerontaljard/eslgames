ESL Games written in Python for Interactive Whiteboards

These games are of simmilar design but different themes, I use them for the interective whitebaords when teaching 
younger students by asking a question and letting the students select a choice. Theere are up to four teams with
a reset button to start over. 

It works on windows and kubuntu, and have used py2exe to create a distributable.
